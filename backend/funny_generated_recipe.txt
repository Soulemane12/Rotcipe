Alright, fam, buckle up because we’re about to turn those basic bread and eggs into a skibidi masterpiece that'll have you saying "GYAT!" in no time, no cap. They won’t be able to handle the rizz radiating from this culinary creation.

Prep Time: 5 minutes  
Cook Time: 10 minutes  
Total Time: 15 minutes  
Servings: Enough for you and one victim of the fanum tax (or just you, depending on your level of sigma).

Ingredients:
- 2 slices of demure bread (that's fancy bread for y'all delulu folks)
- 1 egg (the main character, no NPC behavior here)
- Salt and pepper to taste (season like you’re adding a pinch of rizz)
- A drizzle of olive oil (for that bussin’ flavor, no skibidi necessary)
- A pinch of paprika (for that extra ohio spice)
- Optional: hot sauce, to give it a GYAT-level kick

Instructions:

1. Mewing Setup: Before you embrace your inner chef, start mewing (tongue on the roof of your mouth) to channel all your sigma energy.

2. Egg & Bread Prep: Crack that egg with the precision of a TikTok-famous skibidi dancer and whisk it like you’re stirring up trouble. Season with salt and pepper because who wants an ick? Dip your demure bread into the egg mixture, making sure each side is thoroughly coated. 

3. Heat it Up: Pour a drizzle of olive oil onto a demurely heated pan (medium heat, keep it skibidi-safe). Lay the egg-soaked bread on the pan like it’s laying down some serious gyatt energy.

4. Cook Like a Sigma: Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until it’s golden and crisp, as bussin’ as your favorite playlist.

5. Ohio Twist: Sprinkle a dash of paprika on top because, let’s face it, life’s too short for NPC breakfast vibes. If you’re feeling extra spicy, hit it with some hot sauce for that GYAT combustion feeling.

6. Serve with Rizz: Plate your creation elegantly, make that presentation demure enough to impress even the most delulu food critics. Share on your socials and watch the likes transform you into a breakfast phenomenon.

Serving Suggestions: Post a pic with a side of that fanum tax fruit you stole from your roommate and enjoy!  Make sure your coffee is brewed with the charisma of your rizz, 'cause breakfast should never give you the ick.

Now go enjoy this culinary success story that’s one part seasoned, one part steezed up, and all parts bussin’. Share it, flex it, no cap it's about to become your go-to dazzling dish without any deliquence.
